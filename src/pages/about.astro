      Hey there! I'm Gab Savard, a {age}-year-old computer science student at Dalhousie University (Halifax, NS).

      I have been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest childhood memories
      are actually me playing video games with my dad on the family computer. At that age, I was already interested in
      making my own little video games, for which I would use Basic with my dad's help to code little text-based ones.
      I was 14 when I programmed my first video games by myself, using tools like Game Maker Studio and RPG Maker, before
      eventually learning Unity as well. I knew immediatly that from that point on, I wanted to develop video games forever.

      In high school, I had the chance to take my first real programming class where I learned the basics of computer
      science through Scratch, Arduino and Python. This lead me to look into pursuing my studies in computer science. After
      some experimenting with other fields, I started my Bachelor's of Computer Science in 2022 and I have been loving it
      ever since. This degree gave me many opportunities ranging from participating in different game jams and hackathons to
      creating my own clubs with friends or even getting certifications through Shiftkey Labs.

      When I'm not coding my own video games, apps or various projects, I can probably be found jamming on my guitar,
      composing new tunes, or immersed in a video game. My favourites including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Cities: 
      Skylines</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. I'm also an avid reader and enjoy hiking when I get the chance.

      Every year, I like to give myself goals. Here are my goals for 2024:
