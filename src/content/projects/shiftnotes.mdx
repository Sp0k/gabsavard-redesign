_Shift Notes_ is a note taking app I develop as my course project for ShiftKey
labs' **React Native certification**. I developed the app in JavaScript, using
the React Native framework as well as Tailwind for the styling and Expo for
testing. The app needed to have a few features in order to pass:

- Display the notes using a Mason list
- Create new notes
- Edit notes
- Delete notes
- Have a good UI and theme
- Add a minimum of one feature not seen in the demo app

I ended up adding three features: a prompt before deleting a note to confirm
the action, a share button and auto-scrolling in the editing screen (which you
can see how <a href="/posts/automatic-scroll-view">here</a>)
