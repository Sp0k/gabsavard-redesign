_Shift Notes_ is a note taking app I develop as my course project for ShiftKey
labs' **React Native certification**. I developed the app in JavaScript, using
the React Native framework as well as Tailwind for the styling and Expo for
testing. The app needed to have a few features in order to pass:

- Display the notes using a Mason list
- Filter notes with a search bar
- Create new notes
- Edit notes
- Delete notes
- Have a good UI and theme
- Add a minimum of one feature not seen in the demo app

I ended up adding three features: a prompt before deleting a note to confirm
the action, a share button and auto-scrolling in the editing screen (which you
can see how <a href="/posts/automatic-scroll-view">here</a>)

## The application

_Shift Notes_ is made up of two screens: a home screen that displays all the
notes saved and that the user can scroll through, and an editing screen where
the user can edit the title and/or content of the note selected.

From the home screen, users can go through their notes saved in the app's
database. They can also filter the notes displayed using the search bar at the
top of the screen. Finally, the user can create a new app by clicking on the
"+" button at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the button take the user
to the editing screen where the user can type in a title or the content of its
new note.

Users can also access and edit their note by clicking on them on the home
screen. When they click on it, they will have access to the editing screen from
which they can modify the note's title and/or the note's content. In this
screen, users can also delete or share their notes. The notes also
automatically save. Finally, the edit screen will also auto scroll to the
cursor. This feature was explained in <a href="/posts/automatic-scroll-view">this article</a>.

## Challenges

As this project was a project for a certification, there was bound to be
challenges. The first one was obviously learning React Native as well as
needing a refresher on JavaScript. The bigger challenges were implementing the
features in the app. For example, the search bar was difficult for me to
implement because I was learning how to use Redux as it was the first time I
was seeing that tool. The feature I had the most difficulty with was the
auto-scroll in the editing screen. I ended up doing plenty of research, but
I wasn't able to implement any solutions I found online. So in the end I ended
up coming up with my own solution.

I also found that without a strong base in JavaScript, the learning curve for
React Native is really harsh, but very rewarding.

## Final thoughts

This project was a really fun one to work on. I am so glad I got to work on it
with my dad in since we took the cource together, but I also found learning the
framework really fun and rewarding. I loved working with React Native and I
enjoyed a lot my course. I don't see myself making mobile apps for a living,
but I do think I'll have more fun with React Native.
