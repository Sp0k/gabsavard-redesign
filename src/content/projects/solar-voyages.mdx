In November 2023, my friends and I participated in the *NASA International Space App Challenges*,
which was a nice experience. We decided to take on the space travel agency challenge, for which we
had to design an educative tool about space. We decided that the best way to make that tool fun
would be to design and develop a website for a travel agency which would offer space trips. This
is how Solar Voyages was born.

## Design

Our goal was to build a full-stack website for this challenge. We had planned on using the *Razor
pages* dotNet framework. We also wanted the website to look and feel realistic and professional.
We ended up spending a few hours online (mostly on figma) studying travel agency websites and
designing our website based on what we had found. We started by designing a mobile version, which
came out looking more like a mobile app. We started with the mobile version because we had learned
to develop mobile-first in our classes.

We then proceeded to continue the design by working on the desktop version. Which ended up looking
very different from the mobile version, pushing even more the idea that the mobile version should
have been a mobile app. We ended up coming up with the following designs.

## Development

We ended up only having time to develop two pages of the desktop version of the website. While two
of my teammates tried to set up the database with the framework. The rest of the team with myself
got started on developing the front end. We ended up coding the two pages in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript pure. We only had time to finish the main page and the sign in page. We also sadly ran
out of time and did not get to program more. We also never got to set up the database.

If you were curious to see the code behind our two pages, you can find a zipped folder on our
<a href="https://github.com/Sp0k/SpaceJam2023" target="_blank">repo</a> with the few files of code
we wrote.

## Final thoughts

Even though we never finished what we had planned originally, I think that we learned a lot through
this hackathon. Firstly, I learned key concepts of design which greatly influenced the first
version of my website and how I design my mobile apps now. I am also very proud of what we did. We
received a lot of compliments from the mentors present that day about our code and how much we had
achieved using no framework for our pages.
