_Rootscape_ is a 2D arcade infinite side-scroller Gamepad. Developed in February 2023,
it puts you in the shoes of a young child who steals a mystical root from a magic forest
and then has to survive the attacks from its ghosts and spirits. The team behind the game
was made up of <a href="https://github.com/AnthonySafatli" target="_blank">Anthony Safatli</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/steve040415" target="_blank">Mack Tapp</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/lucy222w" target="_blank">Lucy Woods</a> and myself. The game is
available on its official
<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/rootscape-8" target="_blank">Global Game Jam page</a>
or on its <a href="https://github.com/Sp0k/GGJ2023" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>

## Game Development

_Rootscape_ was my team and I's submission to the 2023 _Global Game Jam_, our first Game Jam,
and for some of us, our first game ever. We ended up doing a 2D side-scroller after understanding
that our original idea was too big for the time we had. We were inspired by games like _Hades_ and
_Scott Pilgrim vs the World_.

We used Unity to develop our game, which was a first for me. I find there was a bit of a learning
curve, but I had a lot of fun with it. We also used Aseprite to design our assets and I composed
a song for the game using FL Studio.

I think our biggest challenge is that we were all inexperienced in game development, but also in
programming in general. We all had only done one semester of university, so we still were not super
comfortable with a lot of programming concepts, some we still hadn't learn that we would've
needed.

We spent a least half of the game jam doing research on how to program our game and watching tutorials
on youtube on the features we wanted. But we ended up with something we can be proud of!

## Final Thoughts

I learned so much with that game. Amongst other things: the unity engine, OOP, how to draw sprites,
and how to organize a project with multiple people. Even though we had so much difficulty to finish
our game (which I would argue is the fun part), I had a blast participating and am looking forward
to my next ones!
