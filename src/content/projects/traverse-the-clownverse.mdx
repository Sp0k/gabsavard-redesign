*Traverse the Clownverse* is a comedy battle game. It was created for the *Global Game Jam 2024*. The game consists of two
phases: the exploration phase and the battle phase. During the exploration phase, you can walk around the campus and explore
to find hidden secrets. Once you find a battle, enter it and test your comedic talent with the game's battle system. *Traverse
the Clownverse* was developped by team Team Name, which was made up of the following people this year: Anthony Safatli, Lucy Woods,
Mack Tapp, Nir Kazatsker, Will Watson, Charlie Baker and myself. The game is available on its official
<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/team-name-7" target="_blank">Global Game Jam page</a> or on its
<a href="https://github.com/Sp0k/Clownverse" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

## Game Description

Welcome to Clown College, you have worked tirelessly to get here and are ready to begin your journey to become the funniest clown. But
when you arrive, things seem... off. An oddly unfunny haze has covered the campus, there is a dark hue to it. It seems that the
professors of the prestigious Clown College have been corrupted by an entity known as the Void Clown. Their laugh-force is being siphoned
to the anti-clown world. You remain uncorrupted and you need to purify them and restore their laughter. In order to save your new school,
you'll have to take part in comedy battles and win against each of the anti-clown.

The recommended commands for the game are as follows:
- [w] [a] [s] [d] keys to move and [spacebar] to jump
- mouse to choose your punchlines
- e to interact

## Game Development

*Traverse the Clownverse* was me team and I's project for the 2024 edition of the *Global Game Jam* which was, once again, on the
Dalhousie University campus. I am very proud of what we accomplished this year. The team and I pushed ourselves further this year by
developing a 3D game. This year, I took on the roles of Game Designer, Sound Designer and Programmer. I also shared the Lead Developer role
with my friend <a href="https://github.com/AnthonySafatli" target="_blank">Anthony Safatli</a>.

Given that only a few members of my team had developped a game in 3D before, I knew this year I needed to keep my design simpler, my scope
and goals smaller than last year. That way, we could make sure to not rush at the end of the jam and cut features we were excited about. The
main mechanic of our game, its combat system, was heavily inspired by *Assassin's Creed: Valhalla*'s slam battles. The player receives a joke
setup and three option to choose from as a punchline. Each round, one punchline is the good one, and is worth 10 points, one is the bad one
and worth -10 points and one is the mediocre option worth -15 points.

This year, we decided to download our assets for the map and the players. But we did everything else by ourselves.
<a href="https://github.com/watson-disambiguation" target="_blank">Watson</a> designed an amazing shader for us to give our assets an infected
look to match the story we came up with.

I also decided that this year, I would go more in-depth with the sound design, so I wrote and produced more tracks. Watson also recorded
himself laugh and boo multiple times in order for me to produce his recording into a crowd of reactions depending on the option chosen by the
player. I also went through my archives and pulled out an older track I produced back when I was applying for music school, the piece *Far West*
from the <a href="/projects/demo-ep">Demo EP</a>.

After I finished the music and sound design. I took a look at the combat system and helped rebuild it from scratch since we were having issues
with it. We ended up staying on campus coding until almost 2:00 am that night to redesign the system, which I finished recoding the next
morning. We decided to use a more object oriented programming (OOP) approach for it and using multiple scripts and array of objects to make it
work instead of one script. With the ability to look back on it now, our first design, made with what we had learned in class, was not best 
suited for Unity 2022 and C#. But it did make a lot of sense for a group of programmers with mostly Java experience for class projects.

The game did not win any award, but we, once again, received multiple compliments and praises for it. We believe we were runner-up for best music.
But this year, we made it to a few reports about the event. We were filmed for some footage for a CTV report about two Global Game Jam events in
Halifax that weekend (Global Game Jam and Global Game Jam Next). I was also interviewed by Ethan Hunt, a student-journalist from *The Signal*
(King's College official newspapers). The article was released a few weeks after the event. If you would like to read it, you can find Hunt's

## Final Thoughts

This year was a really fun edition, there was so many more people than the previous year, and it's always so inspiring to see so many creative minds
in the same place, working together and helping each other. Events like these remind me why I love the game development community.

I clearly feel like I learned even more about game development this year. Last year, I clearly learned the basics of a game jam. But this year,
already knowing what to expect. I could focus on game development itself and I learned so much. I was able to learn how to divide scripts to
make our job easier when developing features. I also learned that video games require an OOP approach for almost everything, as every entity is
just a clone of a class we wrote. After this year's edition, I feel so much more confident in my ability to create a video game and I can't wait
to see what I learn next about the field!

I would like to finish by thanking the mentors that were there helping us through the weekedn as well as *ShiftKey Lab* and Dr. Rina Wehbe for 
organizing the whole event for us again this year. I am looking forward to the next one.

Again, if you would like to checkout the game yourself, you can find it on its official 
<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/team-name-7" target="_blank">Global Game Jam page</a> or on its
<a href="https://github.com/Sp0k/Clownverse" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>. Github will have the most updated versions with bugfixes.
