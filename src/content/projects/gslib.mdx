GSLib is a very own Java library. It is made up of different packages that I have written, each
filled with different methods I either find myself using often, or wanted to try coding for fun.
I wanted my library to include the following categories:

1. File Management
2. Statistics
3. Math
4. Calculus

So far, I have been able to finish and publish the file management package, but I have not yet
finished finished the others. I will also be making sure the whole thing will work with the
latest version of Java.

## Installation

Some installation instructions will be provided soon.

## File Management

This package focuses on my file management methods. It is the smallest the packages in the
library as it contains only 5 methods for now.

### Package features

- File creation: Create a file from an absolute or relative path to the file.
- File deletion: Delete a file from an absolute or relative path to the file.
- File reading: Read in a file and return its content in a String Format.
- File writing: Write a string to a specified file.
- Erase content: Erase the content of a file.

These are the five current features in the package. I am planning on adding a method to
erase specific content. Both erase specific strings and from line x to line y.

### Usage

Each of the methods will print error messages to the terminal if any is encountered.

In order to use the library, you must import it in your project, then call it in the files
that will require it.

With the latest version, you no longer need to create a FileManager object, as I made all
the methods static to the class. Instead, you just import the package into your file and
call the class. Using the **createFile()** method, you can create a new empty file of any
type (specified in your path). The **createFile()** method takes a String _filename_ as
a parameter which should be the absolute or relative path to your file (e.g.
'~/Documents/Example/myFile.txt' or '../myFile.txt').

```java
import GSLib.FileManager;

public class Example {
  void main() {
    String filename = "path/to/your/file"       // If you are using windows, replace the / with \\
    FileManager.createFile(filename);
  }
}
```

You can read a file using the **readFile()** method. The method takes in a String _filename_ as
a parameter in order to locate the file to read. It then scans the entire file and returns its
content as a String.

```java
import GSLib.FileManager;

void main() {
  // ...

  String file = FileManager.readFile(filename);
}
```

To write to a file, you will need to use the **writeToFile()** method. The method takes in a
String _filename_ and a String _content_ as parameters. It will find the file using _filename_
and then writes the String in _content_ in said file.

```java
import GSLib.FileManager;

void main() {
  // ...

  String content = "Hello, World! This is my message!";
  FileManager.writeToFile(filepath, content);
}
```

To erase the content of a file, you can use the **eraseContent()** method which takes in a
String _filename_ parameter to locate the file. It will replace the content of the file with
an empty String.

```java
import GSLib.FileManager;

void main() {
  // ...

  FileManager.eraseContent(filename);
}
```

You can use the **deleteFile()** method to delete files. The method takes in a String _filename_
as a parameter to locate the file and then deletes it.

```java
import GSLib.FileManager;

void main() {
  // ...

  FileManager.deleteFile(filename);
}
```

## My thoughts on this project

Even though I am still working on this project, I find that I have learned a lot already about
programming, the Java language and libraries. I also find that this project was really useful
for me as I am saving myself time when I do projects in Java since now I just import my library
into my new project and can easily use them. I also got to learn a lot about libraries creation
using linux and how to use libraries while coding without IDEs
