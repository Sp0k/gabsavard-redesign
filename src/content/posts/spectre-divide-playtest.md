_Spectre Divide_ is an upcoming **tactical 3v3 first-person shooter game**. I found
out about the game about two weeks before the closed beta started and I got
intrigued by the concept that sets it apart: each player controls two
characters, referred to as `spectres`. I will elaborate more on it later.
The game is developed my Mountaintop Studios, a new game studio from the U.S.A.

## The concept

_Spectre Divide_ comes with a crazy concept I haven't seen done before. Each
player controls two characters on the battlefield. These characters called
`spectres` carry a pad that lets them move to where the other spectre throws it.
Described like this, it might sound confusing, so I'll quote their Steam page:

> Use Duality to freely swap between your second body (called a Spectre) at any
> moment to outplay the enemy team. Strategically place your Spectre to cover
> multiple sites across the map, play two angles at once, and quickly reinforce
> teammates. Death canâ€™t stop you. Your Spectre is a second chance at victory,
> giving you twice the uptime so you can run it back and make sure to hit your
> shots the second time around.

While you are controlling one of your spectres, the other ones stays where you
left it, crouched and will send you alerts if it detects other players. There
are two types of alerts: the **Warning** if it detects an enemy in its area of
detection, and the **Danger** if it has direct view of an enemy/it's getting
attacked.

On top of the duality system, _Spectre Divide_ also offers a sponsor system.
Each player on each team selects a sponsor at the beginning of each match.
The sponsor determines your loadout for the match. Each of them represent a
style of gameplay, from more classic shooter game to more tactical. Each of
the sponsors also have a specific role assigned to them.

| Sponsor                | Role      | Primary Ability               | Secondary Ability              | Tertiary Ability                              |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pinnacle International | Assault   | Splinter Grenade              | Adrena-Link (Self-healing)     | Flash Grenade                                 |
| Morrgen United         | Disruptor | Smoke Shift (Smoke grenade)   | Meltdown (Area damage)         | Hidden Grasp (Hidden trap)                    |
| Bloom Technologies     | Support   | Hex Barrier (Shield)          | Twin Mend (Healing other)      | Swarm Grenade (Area Damage)                   |
| Ryker Industries       | Recon     | Wave Scane (Enemy Detection)  | Hull Mine                      | Acr Sentry (Crowd control / sentry)           |
| Vector Dynamics        | Assault   | Dual Amp (Fire rate buff)     | Vector Wall (Slow moving wall) | Nano Sphere (Period damage)                   |
| Ghost Link Collective  | Disruptor | Holo Wall                     | Dupe                           | Distortion Field (Blur vision inside an area) |
| Muu Robotics           | Support   | Patches (Period Healing)      | Dazzler (Blinding)             | Hyper Dome (Health Shield dome)               |
| Umbra Reconnaissance   | Recon     | PulseFinder (Emeny Detection) | Recon Wing (Enemy Detection)   | Glare Burts (Blinding)                        |

Finally, like a few tactical shooters, you buy your weapons at the beginning of
each rounds. The weapons that will be available depends on how much money you
earned from winning or losing the previous rounds. There are currently 20
unique weapons in the game. What makes the weapon selection different, is that
you buy packages of weapon, you can't select specific guns for both of your
spectres. You buy a package. Meaning you can have one spectre that stays behind
with a precision rifle while the other ones gets close to the fight with an
automatic rifle.

## Getting a handle of the game

In my experience, you get used to the concept in a few matches and you become
able to control both spectres somewhat efficiently kind of quickly. What I find
harder to get used to is the speed of the game. In my few matches testing the
game so far, I was never able to finish a match under 30 minutes. This isn't an
issue at all, the game is fun and the matches are worth the 30 minutes, but it's
hard to only play a quick match. My real issue with the game's speed is the
movement. The game takes a lot of inspiration from the _counter-strike_ games.
I have never played one of those, so I don't know how the movement works in
those games, but I find the speed at which a player moves and the lack of
sprint quite annoying. Situations that I could survive if I was able to sprint
out of them become deathtraps here. Instead of a sprint button, the game gives
you a walk button.

I find that getting used to the loadouts takes some time, you have to try
them through multiple matches in order to really get a feel for them and see
which one works best for you. But the loadouts designs are really interesting
and work well in the game's universe. The guns also take some getting used to
based on how much fps you have played and the gun you choose.

## My thoughts on the game

Overall, this game has a lot of potential and it will be really hard to mess it
up. I am not usually a big fan of fps games, but this one just got my attention
and it keeps me entertained. I am also a big fan of the cyberpunk vibe of the
game and the designs of the 3 maps and the weapons. I know this game is not
finished yet, but for now, I give it a note of **8.5/10**. I am very excited for
the full release and can't wait to see what will happen in the future with this
game!
